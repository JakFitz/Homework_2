# For this homework i had to build a portfolio webpage from scratch

First i worked on the html, creating the barebones structure of my website

After that was done I created a CSS stylesheet and began styling the page

I found placeholder images on source.unsplash.com

finally i made the webpage accomodate both small and large screens
